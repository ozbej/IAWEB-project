Problems
--------

o English interface with German names

	If you want to enter you entrance and end station German names are suggested. (Would be okay if the name of the Station is German but you enter the city name)

	Heuristic: Error Prevention
	How reproducible? : Hovering over the drop-down menu at the top of the page
