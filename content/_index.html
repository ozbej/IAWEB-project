<p>
In general, I much prefer teaching face-to-face than online. However,
due to CoViD restrictions, it will not be possible to teach everything
face-to-face. The plan for this semester is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Lectures will be held online with Webex.
See my guide to <a href="./guides/guide-using-webex/">Using Webex</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Client Meetings (Abgabegespräche) will be held face-to-face under the
university's CoViD regulations.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Exams (MC Tests) will be held face-to-face under the university's
CoViD regulations.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The Grading Review (Einsichtnahme) will be held face-to-face under the
university's CoViD regulations.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the CoViD situation demands, then the plan may have to change.

<td>Registration:</td>
<td>
<p>
Sign up in groups of 4 on
<a href="http://online.tugraz.at/">TUGRAZonline</a>.
<br/>Starting Mon 21 Feb 2022 14:00.
<br/>Ending Sun 27 Feb 2022 23:59.
<br/>Registration has now closed.
<!--
<br/><span class="important">Registration has now closed.</span>
-->
</p>
<p>
Form your own groups. If you have friends and colleagues who you know
you can work well with, coordinate in advance and all sign up for the
same group at the same time. Depending on the exact number of
participants, there may end up being a few groups of three rather than
four.
</p>
<p>
If all the groups are full, I will create new groups as necessary.
However, I will only do this once most of the existing groups are
full, so that groups are spread fairly evenly across the tutors. For
internal accounting reasons, one or more of the tutors may sometimes
have less groups than the other tutors.
</p>
<p>
If you do not know anybody else, sign up for any group with a free
place and contact the other group members by email using the
<a href="./practicals/email-group/">"Mail an TeilnehmerInnen"
function</a> in TUGRAZonline. Do <em>not</em> post "I am looking for a
group" or "Who else is in my group?" messages to the course newsgroup.
</p>
<p>
<em>If you register for the course, but later decide not to participate,
please have the courtesy to unregister from the course.</em>
</p>
<p>
After the unregistration deadline, if you wish to unregister from the
course, please contact me by email. Depending on how far the course
has already progressed, I will either unregister you without
penalty or (more likely) grade your work up to that point.
</p>
<p>
If you do not respond to emails from your group colleagues, or do not
actively participate, I reserve the right to remove you from the
course (with grade 5).
</p>
<p>
It sometimes happens that one group member does not actively
participate and most (or all) of the work is done by the other group
members. If this happens in your group and you feel you are carrying
an inactive group member, let your tutor know and only write the names
of the active group members on the reports you hand in.

<td>Prerequisites:</td>
<td>
<p>
For the practical exercises, it is assumed that you have good
knowledge of HTML5 and some CSS3. You should also understand what
plain text files and UTF-8 are.
</p>
<p class="note">
If you do not have any prior experience of these, you may
wish to refer to Section 2.2 (plain text and UTF-8) and Chapters 10
(Polyglot HTML5) and 11 (CSS3) of my
<a href="https://courses.isds.tugraz.at/inm2014/inm.pdf">
INM 2014 course notes</a> (or similar material elsewhere).
<a href="https://htmldog.com/">HTML Dog</a> provide good tutorials into HTML and CSS.

<tr>
<td>Aims and Objectives of Course:</td>
<td>
<p>
Students will gain an overview of the theory of human-computer
interaction. They will have an appreciation of how to design usable
interfaces and will gain the knowledge necessary to perform heuristic
evaluations and thinking aloud tests of user interfaces.

skip one or more of the exercises.
</p>
<p>
Attendance at the Client Meetings (Abgabegespräche) is compulsory.

This is where I will post news and announcements and where you should
ask any questions you might have. It is also the right place to look
to see if your questions have already been answered.

If you are not familiar with newsgroups, you should refer to
Chapter 2 of my

<tr>
<td>Breaches of Academic Integrity:</td>
<td>
<p>
Write in your <em>own</em> words. Copying the work of others (from the
web, another group, or elsewhere) and then submitting the work as
(part of) your own work is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism">plagiarism</a> and
is a serious breach of academic integrity. Any text passages written
by others, or images created by others, must clearly be identified as
such. By taking this course, you agree to have your work submitted to
plagiarism detection services. Your work may also be cross-checked
against other work submitted in the same and previous years.
</p>

<p class="note">
Assembling a collage of stolen text fragments, possibly with some
slight editing or rearrangement, and handing them in as your own words
is not acceptable, even if you reference the original source. If you
are not well-practiced in the ways of academic citation (i.e. how not
to plagiarise), I strongly recommend that you read Chapter 5 of my
<a href="https://courses.isds.tugraz.at/inm2014/inm.pdf#chapter.5">INM
2014 course notes</a> and some of the resources on Debora
Weber-Wulff's
<a href="http://plagiat.htw-berlin.de/start-en/">Plagiarism Portal</a> web site.
</p>


<p>
If you help a fellow student in another group, be careful that you do
not disclose your exact solution or work. If the group you help submits
substantially identical work to your group, both groups will be
punished for plagiarism.
</p>

<p>
Do not fake. Faking data (for example, inventing the list of problems
for a heuristic evaluation) is a serious breach of academic integrity.
</p>

<p>
The university has a
<a href="https://mibla.tugraz.at/08_09/Stk_1/EthikKodex1_0_1008.pdf">
code of conduct</a>, a set of
<a href="https://tu4u.tugraz.at/go/gute-wissenschaftliche-praxis-richtlinie">
guidelines</a>,
and <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/fileadmin/public/Studierende_und_Bedienstete/Satzung_und_Geschaeftsordnungen_der_TU_Graz/Satzungsteil_Plagiat.pdf">regulations</a>
regarding academic integrity. Breaches of academic integrity are very
serious and will be punished appropriately where discovered.
