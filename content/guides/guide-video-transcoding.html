<h2>Video Transcoding</h2>


<p>
With video, <em>transcoding</em> is the process of changing the
resolution, quality, and/or encoding (parameters) of a video track,
all of which involve re-encoding the entire video (and thus inevitable
loss of quality).
</p>

<p>
With audio, <em>transcoding</em> is the process of changing the
quality and/or encoding (parameters) of an audio track, both of which
involve re-encoding the entire audio track (and thus inevitable loss
of quality).
</p>

<p class="note">
I am assuming here that we are working with lossy video and audio
codecs, such as H.264 for video and AAC for audio.

<h3>1 Transcoding to a Lower Pixel Resolution</h3>

<p>
When transcoding to a lower pixel resolution, scale the video
uniformly down so that it fits as best it can into the new smaller
dimensions. Do <em>not</em> distort the video and do <em>not</em>
create black or empty strips to either side (or top and bottom).
</p>

<p>
For example, screen video captured on a OnePlus 6 smartphone
in portrait mode is 1080×2340 pixels. If this has to be transcoded
to fit into FullHD portait at 1080×1920, then the new video
size will be 886×1920, as shown in Figure <a href="#figure-1">1</a>.
