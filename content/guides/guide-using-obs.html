<h1 class="title">Using OBS Studio</h1>



<p>
OBS Studio
(<a href="https://obsproject.com/"><code>obsproject.com</code></a>) is
a powerful, free, and open-source software suite for video recording
and live streaming. It can combine multiple input video and audio
signals and record (or stream) them, and so is very useful for screen
and session capture. OBS Studio is available for Windows, Mac, and
Linux.
</p>


<p>
The best strategy is to record initally in MKV format, then later
remux without loss of quality (File → Remux Recordings) to MP4 format.
</p>
<p class="note">
If a recording somehow crashes, an MP4 file cannot be closed properly
and the recording is corrupted and lost.  An MKV can be recovered.
</p>

<p>
OBS Studio records audio in AAC format by default.

<h2>3 Troubleshooting</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
If you are trying to capture a Chrome browser window, and all you see
is an empty frame, try disabling hardware acceleration in Chrome
Settings (Settings - System - Use hardware acceleration when available
= Off).
