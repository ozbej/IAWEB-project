<!--
<p>
Exact lists of groups will be published here in due course.

<p>
The grading review will be face-to-face and will take place under
whatever
<a href="covid-regulations.html">COVID regulations</a> are in force at
the time.
</p>

<p class="note">
The university has lifted all COVID restrictions as of 25 Apr 2022.
If COVID restrictions are reintroduced, the consolidated time slot
shown below will be readjusted accordingly (bookable individual slots
per group).
</p>




<h2>Grading Review</h2>

<p>
Attendance at the grading review is <em>not</em> compulsory. If you
are happy with your grade, you do not have to attend.
</p>

<p>
If your grade is not what you expected, or if you have any questions
about the grading, the grading review is your chance. Your tutor will
explain the points which lead to your grade.
</p>
<p class="note">
We do sometimes make mistakes, for example when entering data or
selecting ratings in Sapphire. If we find such a mistake, the points
and grade will of course be corrected.
