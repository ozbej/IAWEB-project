<h1 class="title">Slots for MC2</h1>

<p>
See the general description of the <a href="../exercises/ex4.html">MC Test</a>.
</p>



<p>
The test will be face-to-face and will take place under whatever
<a href="../exercises/covid-regulations.html">COVID regulations</a> are in force at
the time.
</p>

<p class="note">
The university has lifted all COVID restrictions as of 25 Apr 2022.
If COVID restrictions are reintroduced, the time slots shown below
may have to be adjusted slightly.

<h2>1 Second MC Test (MC2)</h2>

<p>
You must sign up for MC2 by sending me email
(<a href="mailto:kandrews@iicm.edu?subject=MC2%20Signup">kandrews@iicm.edu</a>)
before
<span class="important">Fri 24 Jun 2022 18:00</span> stating your
<em>name</em>, <em>group</em>, and <em>MatrNr</em>, and using the
subject “MC2 Signup”.
</p>

<!--
<p class="important">
The deadline for signup has now passed.
</p>
-->


<p>
You may choose to take MC2 regardless of how many correct questions
you got in MC1, or whether you took MC1 at all. However, the
result of the most recent MC test <em>replaces</em> that of any
earlier test, so it is also possible to downgrade your result.
