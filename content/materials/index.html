<p>
Use the materials here as templates for your heuristic evaluation (HE).
</p>

<!--
<p class="important">
These are the materials from SS 2021. The materials for SS 2022 will
be made available in due course.
</p>
-->


<!--
<p>
The materials are now ready for SS 2019.
</p>
-->



<!--
Only zip those materials which are ready !!
-->


<ul>
<li>
<a href="en/">English</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
Save the materials using the zip file, or by right-clicking the link
and using "Save Link As...".  If you load a HTML page into a web
browser and then use "Save Page As...", you sometimes get
an <em>altered</em> copy rather than the exact original.
</p>



<p>
Do <em>not</em> base your reports on the materials or the sample
reports from previous years!! The materials are updated every year.
</p>

<!--
<p>
I consider the English versions of the materials to be the definitive
versions. If you are using the German versions and notice any
inconsistencies, please cross-check with the corresponding English
version and let me know.
