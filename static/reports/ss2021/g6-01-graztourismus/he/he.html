                <h2 >1 Executive Summary</h2>

                <p>
                    The report contains the heuristic evaluation of <a href="https://www.graztourismus.at/en">www.graztourismus.at</a>. 
                    First, every evaluator has executed the heuristic evaluation (a specific usability analyzation method, see chapter <a href="#chapter-3-1">3.1</a>) individually using different browsers and on distinct devices and setups.
                    The findings have been documented in log files and supported with short descriptive videos. Finally, the results have been aggregated and ranked by severity.<br>
                </p>
                    <p>
                        One crucial negative finding was the misleading and inconsistent design which often lead to confusion.
                        For example: some icons do not flip on sections where it should actually be the case,
                        hyperlinks are not highlighted, some images/text paragraphs are missing, some pictures/elements are
                        cut off, errors are not immediately recognizable, the documentation provided is not applicable and insufficient clarity on
                        how to open or close something (navigation elements, menu options, ...).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another finding to be improved is the long loading time. Especially with the video on the start page or when downloading
                        brochures, you have to wait a while for the actual task to begin. That is not justifiable with todays' technological possibilities. 
                        Regarding the brochures, furthermore, the download size should be stated to avoid unwanted mobile data usage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a lack of orientation, too. A guide to make the first use easier would be nice.
                        For example, a misplaced click takes one to another page. But if one wants to go back, the site is newly loaded and one has to search from the top again.
                        Furthermore, descriptions for abbreviations that a user might not be familiar with should be provided.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another aspect to be improved was that a number of elements were not displayed completely legibly.
                        The background images were missing behind some of the subtitles and a map was cut off once. Some filter and search options did not perform
                        the expected, intuitive behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Various forms throughout the website lacked correct input validation and it was possible to send the forms with syntactically invalid input.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last but not least, we listed the missing translation of some parts of the website. 
                        If one had set the website's language to English, one would not expect to encounter any german paragraph.
                    </p>

                <p>However, the website also offers many outstanding positive features.</p>

                    <p>
                        As the best feature of the website the section "Our tips" had been selected by the evaluators.
                        This was very helpful for the user and gives a good overview about the most important facts of a selected destination / chosen element.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second best aspect was the searching function in general. We could go back to the history of our queries and then edit them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The design of the map and the options (zoom, destinations displayed with background information) were very informative and appealing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we selected the watchlist. It can be very helpful if you are planning a trip and want to save the 
                        destinations as a PDF and send them to friends by email, for example.

                <p>
                    The usability of the official tourism portal of the city of Graz was inspected using an
                    Heuristic Evaluation.
                    The website provides information on various sight-seeing highlights, events and local restaurants.
                    It proposes shopping adventures as well as trips in and around Graz.
                    In order to convince people visiting Graz and to leave a positive impression, the website should
                    appeal to as many user groups as possible across different societies.
                    To achieve the aims of the portal, usability is of the utmost importance.
                    With the Heuristic Evaluation of this website, we wanted to filter out the positive and negative
                    aspects to ensure a high quality website with a great usability.

                <p>
                    The heuristic evaluation is a specific method of analysing usability for various types of user
                    interfaces,
                    first described by Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich in 1990.
                    A team of so called 'evaluators' systemically checks and analyses the interface design for potential
                    usability-problems
                    taking a small number of different principles into account. For this evaluation, the "Andrews
                    General Usability Heuristics" (based on Nielsen's revised set of ten
                    usability heuristics [<a href="./he.html#ref-Nie1994">Nie1994</a>]), shown in Appendix <a href="./he.html#appsecHeuristics">A.1</a>, will be used.<br>
                    According to a study conducted by Nielsen and Molich in 1990, it is important to have a whole team of
                    evaluators in order to be able to find as many flaws in the design as possible and to deliver good results.
                    Individuals, in contrast, only found between 20% and 51% of the known problems according to this
                    study.
                    [<a href="./he.html#ref-Nie1990">Nie1990</a>]
                </p>

                <p>
                    An Heuristic Evaluation step by step [<a href="./he.html#ref-And2021">And2021</a>, <a href="./he.html#ref-Won2020">Won2020</a>]:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The design (e.g. the website) is determined and the ten heuristics are presented to the
                        evaluators for analysis.
                        It should be noted that - in order to find as many flaws as possible without a having a huge
                        number of participants - these evaluators are not the end users, already have domain expertise
                        in the field of industry of the product and are experts in usability (so called
                        'double-experts'). [<a href="./he.html#ref-Nie1992">Nie1992</a>]
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        At first, evaluators work on their own. Each evaluator searched for potential problems and
                        positive findings. All findings were gathered in a table.
                        In addition, they identify specific parts they want to assess.
                        Afterwards, the noted potential problems were examined in detail.
                    </li>

                    <li>Then, they should record problems as accurately as possible.</li>

                    <li>Finally, the findings of all experts were aggregated and again individually rated with
                        respect to the problem's severity such that afterwards a full list, order by severity, can be
                        provided.
                        In the end, the result should be presented to the customer and possible solutions to these problems are
                        discussed.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    In relation to other methods, heuristic evaluation is rather cheap and can already be used at the start
                    of the development process of a product. The application is also quite self-explanatory
                    and usually both major and minor problems are identified and dealt with later.
                    Although it can happen that domain-specific problems could possibly be bypassed,
                    the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. [<a href="./he.html#ref-And2021">And2021</a>]

                <p>
                    The site is trying to acquire as much users as possible who are interested in visiting Graz and / or
                    in getting to know
                    which attractions, sight-seeing spots, restaurants, current events and trip possibilities Graz
                    offers.<br>
                    Therefore, we can distinguish between the following groups of users:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        People not living in Austria, who are likely not speaking german and who are trying to plan a
                        trip to Graz.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Austrian people planning a trip to Graz.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        People who are just gathering some information about Graz, with no intention of visiting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        People searching for a specific information on the website.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    The goals and tasks of these groups are respectively:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Obtain information on what are the most important sight-seeing spots in Graz, get to know the
                        culture of Graz,
                        probably search for some already planned trip (as detailed knowledge of what can be visited when
                        and how is not present),
                        find an accomodation and organize transportation. Maybe also assess whether a trip to Graz is
                        worth the circumstances.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Obtaining information on what sight-seeing attractions the users have not seen yet. Maybe they
                        do not
                        want to take part in an organized trip but instead explore the city on their own. Furthermore,
                        obtaining
                        information on shopping and restaurant possibilities may be more important to this group
                        than to the first. Apart from that,
                        Austrian visitors tend to have a more concrete expectation and reason from and for visiting Graz
                        than the first group.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        People just gathering information about Graz will likely do not want to get a ton of offers for accommodation
                        and currently
                        existing promos in shopping halls but a discrete and full list of e.g. the sight-seeing
                        attractions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This group of users wants to get the specific information they are looking for as fast as
                        possible
                        without any further distraction and long ways of click through the website.

                    Anna (using Ubuntu) and Christof (using macOS) used OBS Studio to make screen recordings with audio commentary.
                    Emil and Fabian on macOS used the built-in macOS screen recorder for creating the recordings.<br>
                    As far as possible (local restrictions may apply, e.g. Anna's browser resolution does not support Full HD), we recorded with the following settings:<br>
                    Planned video settings: MP4 Output Video; Resolution: 1920×1080; Frame Rate: 20; Codec: H.264; Rate Control: VBR; Bit Rate: 5000 Kbps.<br>
                    Planned audio settings: Stereo Codec: AAC; Sample Rate: 44 kHz; Bit Rate: 160 Kbps; Bits per Sample: 32.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    All positive and negative findings were recorded seperately and commented accordingly after the first session.
                    In case some findings cannot be reproduced, we extracted the corresponding video clips out of the fully recorded initial session.
                    For this, Anna used LosslessCut 3.32.0 on Ubuntu, whereas, Christof, Emil and Fabian on macOS used QuickTime Player to extract video clips from their screen
                    recordings.
