Negative Findings (Problems)
-----------------

o CF-PC-Neg01

  Title:  Navigation issue with 'home'-symbol

  Description:

  The 'home'-symbol in the navigation is clickable in a position where it seems like I would click on another navigation point. This issue only occurs for the left-most navigation entry in the main navigation on top of the site.


  Video Clip:  cf-pc-neg01-navigation-home-symbol.mp4

  Heuristic:  A02 Speak the Users' Language

  How Reproducible?:  Go from the 'home'-symbol (in the vertical middle) to the right until the navigation menu is opened


o CF-PC-Neg02

  Title:  Loading a video takes very long

  Description:

  Although a busy cursor and some loading symbol is provided, loading a short video takes longer than a user would accept it to do.

  Heuristic:  A01 Feedback

  How Reproducible?:  On the homepage, scroll down and click on "Graz Video"

  How Reproducible?:  On the homepage, scroll down to TOP EVENTS, select one and go back again


o CF-PC-Neg04

  Title:  Icons should flip by convention

  Description:

  On the homepage, usually all icons adhering to this type of link flip when hovering over them. With one such link this mechanism is broken.

  Heuristic:  A04 Consistency

o CF-PC-Neg05 [corresponds to CF-Mob-Neg07]

  Title:  Links not highlighted nor clickable

  Description:

  Usually, links are highlighted in a specific way and are made clickable throughout the website. However, in the data protection information text the convention was broken.

  Heuristic:  A04 Consistency

  Heuristic:  A08 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

  How Reproducible?:  Good to know -> Our Team -> "Print this page"

  Heuristic:  A04 Consistency

  How Reproducible?:  Good to know -> About us -> Tourism Coach


o CF-PC-Neg08

  How Reproducible?:  Go to "See & Do" -> last element of the side navigation

o CF-PC-Neg09 [corresponds to CF-Mob-Neg22]

  Title:  Contradictory information provided

  Description:

  On the bottom of the page it says "Mo - So 10.00 - 17.00". However, in the Service section it is specified that we can reach out to the office by phone Mo - Fr 09:00 - 17:00 and Sa - So 10:00 - 17:00.

  How Reproducible?:  Go to "Good to know" -> Service -> Information Bureau

  Heuristic:  A08 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

  How Reproducible?:  Go to "Good to know" -> Service -> Brochures


o CF-PC-Neg12

  Title:  Filtering with keywords

  Description:

  Although at least five brochures have the keyword "Graz" already on their cover, when filtering for "Graz", we only obtain three brochures. As the keyword filtering is not explained, I cannot make up how it works as my first intuition seems to not be applicable.

o CF-PC-Neg15 [corresponds to CF-Mob-Neg19]

o CF-PC-Neg16 [corresponds to CF-Mob-Neg30]

  Title: Inconsistency with opening images in full screen

  Description:

  As learned throughout the website, the yellow rectangle with the black arrow in it in the right-bottom corner of the image suggests that you can click the image and open it in full screen. However, this does not work in the presented representation.


  Video Clip:  cf-pc-neg16-full-screen-images-consistency.mp4

o CF-PC-Neg19 [corresponds to CF-Mob-Neg09]

  Title: Redirection to Facebook site where other behavior expected

  Description:

  When clicking on an item in the side navigation, we usually get to a site of the Graz Tourism platform. However, in this case we instantly get to a Facebook site.

o CF-PC-Neg23

  Title: URL not shortened when printing

  Description:

  When storing the watchlist as a PDF, users might print the PDF and if they want to get further information later on again, they have to enter the full URL of this sightseeing-spot. URL shortening would have led to more efficiency.

o CF-PC-Neg27
