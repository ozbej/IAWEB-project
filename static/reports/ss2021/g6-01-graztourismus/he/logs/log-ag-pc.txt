Negative Findings (Problems)
-----------------

o AG-PC-Neg01 

  Title:  Other naming might be confusing

  Description:

  At the top of the main page, if you click on the subpage "Christmas", a new page is loaded, but with URL ".../advent".
  The other naming might be confusing for people who e.g. don't know the word "Advent".

o AG-PC-Neg03  

  Title:  Omit unnecessary designation

  Description:

  At the upper right corner on the main page and on all subpages, "Italian" and "Deutsch" are enough. 
  "Languages" before these words is not necessary.
  In this case it complements the pattern, e.g. also for "Our websites", but it can be omitted because it is self-explanatory anyway.

o AG-PC-Neg04  

  Title:  Search function is not visible everywhere
