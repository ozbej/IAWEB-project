Problems
--------

o Printout timetable from booked ticket

  The description at the link says that you can also print the timetable here. 
  Is an important function and should work. 
  Unfortunately there is no function to print the timetable here.

  Heuristic:  A04 Consistency

  How reproducible?:  Book Ticket - select ticket - my basket - link under "total amount"




o Unnecessary text 

  This unimportant information at the bottom of this page can also be found on other pages. 
  But there should be a separate page for people who are interested. 
  So this unnecessary text only needs space.

  Heuristic:  A08 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

  How reproducible?:  on each site
  
  
  
  
  o Chance contrast

  You can adjust the contrast between text and background, but nothing really changes.

  Heuristic:  A07 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

  How reproducible?:  Homepage
  
  
  
  
  o Several people 

  If you add several people here, the list can become very confusing and long. 
  Bad layout.

  Heuristic:  A08 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

  How reproducible?:  Book Ticket - change person 
  
  
  
  
  o Site does not fit

  The Search Connections page looks a bit strange. Should fit better to the screen. 
  It also looks rather small.

  Heuristic:  A08 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

  How reproducible?:  Main - search connection
  
  
  
  
  o Too much on Homepage

  The homepage looks generally very overloaded. Too many pictures and unnecessary information.

  How reproducible?:  Homepage

  o Some infos are in german (also on mobile)

  On the current restrictions site informations are displayed in German. 
  People who don't know german must translate this page. 
  But they won't do it and they are missing important information that concerns them.

  Heuristic:  A02 Speak the Usersâ€™ Language

  How reproducible?:  Main page - current restrictions

  A useful page is always FAQ for general questions. But you won't find them here at first sight. You have to search for them. 

  Video clip:  n-tt-pc-faqs-missing.mp4

  Heuristic:  A10 Help and Documentation

  How reproducible?:  none or search for FAQs 
  
  
  
  
  o No Breadcrumps
