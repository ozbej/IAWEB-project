<h2>Heuristic Evaluation of the Web Site</h2>

<section id="secExecutiveSummary" aria-labelledby="secExecutiveSummaryHeading">
<h2 id="secExecutiveSummaryHeading">1 Executive Summary</h2>

<p>
Overall the website offers good usability and fulfills it's purpose with neat and mostly easy to use features. 
Nonetheless it still harbours some problems, which will be explained in more detail in the following report.
</p>
<p>
The evaluation was conducted by four evaluators, each one individually gathering positive and negative findings. 
The findings of all team members were individually scored in their severity to determine most critical and positive findings.
</p>
<p>
The most severely rated problem is a check box in the "terms of use" section that would not save the users setting regarding cookies. 
The check box itself on the "terms of use" page is also hidden in a scrollable text. 
For the users the placement of the box may come across questionable. The fact that the site does not save the users choice about cookies can lead to dissatisfaction.
</p>
<p>
What stood out as a positve finding was the good overall construction of the Homepage, which instantly presents some of the most important features it has to offer directly available for use.
We had no problems in finding the functionality to take on the most common tasks.
</p>
<p>
A following negative finding was the missing information and confusing options around the first class ticket for weekly and monthly tickets.
The ticket options state first and second class. Though looking down at the extras section first class is still selectable there. Also the price for first class 
equals the choosen basis ticket. Clear Indication and information for the user is missing here.
</p>
<p>
Another good finding we agreed on was the possibility to virtually walk through the different sections of a train.
</p>
<p>
The advertisement and note to use the ÖBB apps on the website are pretty useful, but the link to the Huawei App Gallery doesn't correctly redirect the user. 
</p>
<p>
The ability to mark the most often used or most relevant train connections in the ticket shop proves to be a valuable asset of the website. 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand a rather unpleasing finding was the fact that to disable the use of cookies the user has to navigate through the site to the "Terms of Use" and uncheck a check box there. 
This is not a conventional way of disabling and enabling the use of cookies.
 </p>
<p>
The ability to also mark the most often used or most relevant train connections in the ticket shop also proves to be a valuable asset of the website. 
 </p>
<p>
Our team did encounter a few problems that we rated severy and in our opinion need to be changed.
But while certainly having its flaws, the basic functionality of the website is given.

<section id="secIntroduction" aria-labelledby="secIntroductionHeading">
<h2 id="secIntroductionHeading">2 Introduction</h2>

<p>
The website to be evaluated is "www.oebb.at", the official website of the austrian railway network.
The website is used to gather information about the timetable, ticket costs and services of the oebb and to acquire tickets. 
We want to evaluate this web site, because it is very important for many people depending on public transportation to have a reliable platform.
</p>

<section id="secEvaluationProcedure" aria-labelledby="secEvaluationProcedureHeading">
<h2 id="secEvaluationProcedureHeading">3 Evaluation Procedure</h2>

<p>
This section describes the procedure used in the heuristic evaluation.
</p>
<p>
A heuristic evaluation is a usability test which can be taken on any kind of computer application or device to find usability flaws.
</p>
<p>
The evaluation was conducted by a team consisting of four members. Each evaluator individually evaluated the website and filmed short clips of the positive and negative findings. After the evaluation, the findings of every team member were put together and individually scored in their severity or positivity. After the scoring they were sorted in their new order.
</p>
<p>
The tests were conducted individually by every evaluator on a Desktop PC or laptop and on a mobile phone.
</p>
<section id="subsecEvaluationMethodology" aria-labelledby="subsecEvaluationMethodologyHeading">
<h3 id="subsecEvaluationMethodologyHeading">3.1 Evaluation Methodology</h3>


<p>
Heuristic evaluation is defined by Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich as an informal method of analyzing an interface design in 1990. [Nie1990]
</p>
<p>
Heuristic evaluation is a practical method to help developers evaluate a user interface design with a small set of test users. It is a fast, cheap and easy approach to detect usability problems. This analysis is intended to improve the user-friendliness of interfaces, for example a website.  
To achieve a significant evaluation result, a group of 5-8 people should examine the design for usability problems. The evaluators have to understand the purpose of the system or product and what the target users goals are. To understand this needs, user personalities have to be defined before the evaluation.
It is important that the test users evaluate the user interface individually. This ensures a higher percentage of the heuristic problems found. The individual test users capture the positives and negatives they discovered ranked according to their severity. The notes must be precisely specified and identified. [Phil2017]
</p>
<p>
For this evaluation, the "Andrews General Usability Heuristics", shown in Appendix A.1, will be used. These are based on and slightly adapted from Nielsen's revised set of ten usability heuristics. This illustration provides guidance for the evaluators, pointing out what they should pay attention to and what the system or product should be able to do. For each heuristic problem a scale from 0-5 is used. [Nie1994]. 
</p>
<p>
It is good practice to evaluate the product at least twice. A roughly walk through the interface followed by a more detailed analysis. If the system is used by several kinds of devices, it also makes sense to perform the evaluation on a few different ones. This way it can be ensured that the interface is likely to work for the end user as well. Once the results of the individual evaluators have been fully documented, they can exchange views and determine which heuristic problems are serious and which are minor and list them. This way, the expert knows what to focus on during the revision. [Nie1995]

<section id="subsecUserProfiles" aria-labelledby="subsecUserProfilesHeading">
<h3 id="subsecUserProfilesHeading">3.2 User Profiles</h3>


<p>
The typical users of the website are people who use the public transport system. The variety of the user is therefore huge. Users that come to your mind are seniors, teenagers, environmentally conscious, tourists, disabled people, students, workers, school classes and families. These users can be grouped in four categories: people with handicaps (seniors, disabled), groups (tourists, school classes, families), people with technical knowhow (student, worker, teenager), people without technical knowhow (seniors, workers).</p>
<p>The general user will use the website to book a ticket and find all available trains on the timetable.</p>
<p>People with handicaps can use the website to gather information about the handicapped accessible of the train station and trains. This group will also often want to make seat reservations.</p>
<p>Groups will use the website to book a large number of tickets and try to find some information about a group discount or the capacity of the train. If you are in a big group it is important to have a reliable information source to plan in advanced.</p>
<p>People, who travel alone and have no experience with online booking, need a pretty simple and manageable website. Additionally the information about changes of arrival and departure time should be very easy to find.</p>
<p>For people who have experience with the website will want a fast way to book a ticket, in the best case, the system remembers the usual journeys and makes a suggestion. Frequent users will properly use the mobile version more than the other groups to book and find the right train.</p>

First class price

<p>
When buying a weekly or monthly ticket, the information and options around the first class provided for confusion. The ticket options state first and second class. Though looking down at the extras section first class is still selectable there. 
Also the price for first class equals the choosen basis ticket, eg. monthly. 
Not only is there no clear indication whether or not the extra needs to be booked to use first class, the price also is irritating for exactly doubling costs which adds to the confusion. 
</p>
<p>
A solution to that would be a clear presentation of information. Do I have a ticket that goes first class? Remove the extra if its included, if not, remove the misleading text on the ticket information. 
Clearly indicate the price for the extra equals the ticket price to assure the user that this is intended, if so.

The evaluator noticed that if you are satisfied with the service and you want to make this known in the feedback, you should participate in a survey. 
This question can be misleading. After all, you are already writing the feedback and you do not want to have to participate in a survey. This problem is described in Figure <a href="#figure-7">7</a>.
</p>

<p>
Add an additional check box, which the users can tick or untick for participating in the survey, when sending a feedback form.

You can only view the timetable on the page without being able to print or download it. You can see this problem in Figure <a href="#figure-8">8</a>.
